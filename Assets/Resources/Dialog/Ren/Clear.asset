  dialog:
  - Woah, you found me.
  - "The explosion was pretty cool, too bad you weren\u2019t there to see it..."
  - I wonder who put explosives in the wall though, thats weird.
  - Were you expecting a reward for all that? I don't... really have one.
  - Why did you even come here? And like... Who even made this room and why? It's...
    Pointless?
  - Maybe there's some secret passageway hidden in the walls that actually gives
    something useful.
  - You're sure to find it if you bang your head on every wall!
  - Or maybe there isn't one at all, but you can never know can you? :)
  - After all, someone must have made this for a reason, no?
  - Or maybe no one made this at all.
  - I doubt a puzzle like this would be naturally occurring, though...
  - Wait... How did I even get here in the first place?
  - How did you get here? Have you ever thought about that?
  - Well, no use having an existential crisis over this.
  - Though... The idea of freedom beckons me, a place outside of these limited walls.
  - You can see a little of whats there, but who really knows if there's anything
    of value.
  - It could just be a wasteland of debris and random structures, but it still piques
    my curiosity.
  - Even if there's nothing useful or interesting there, I still want to know what
    It'd be like out there.
  - And who knows, maybe you will find something in there.
  - After all, there seems to be secrets everywhere in this world.
  - Secret entrances to new rooms, you've seen them, havent you?
  - Of course you have. You wouldn't be here otherwise.
  - Was it the journey that was fulfilling?
  - Maybe you found meaning in the process,  or...
  - Did you do all of this just to hit that 100% completion? That'd be silly.
  - Even if the answer is as simple as that, it is at the very least interesting
    to think about.
  - Well, I don't have much more to say, you probably should like... Go?
  - I'll see you again, or maybe I won't.
