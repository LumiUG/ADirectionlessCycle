  - The Gummi version of ADC... The best version.
  - A relic of the past- Okay, I'm joking, we've got Github.
  - ADC was meant to be a simple sokoban game to test the waters with Unity.
  - It still is, but it's grown a lot closer to me that I expected.
  - That has been mostly because of how much time I've poured into this.
  - The game started to spiral out of control after deciding to make the cycle ability
    go into other screens.
  - Why?? The game was already finished, why would I ever do that???
  - I suppose, part of me wanted to make something bigger. And hey, it paid off.
  - After adding cycling, and multiple screens, I think it took me around 3-4 months
    to rework everything.
  - Would definitely do it all again! That was really fun.
  - Hopefully no one ruined the cycling reveal for you. I would... bite them.
  - ...Yeah, not much to see here, let's keep the ball rolling!
