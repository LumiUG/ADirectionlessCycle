  - This is most of the game's flowchart!
  - It has been under very heavy reworks, due to the project scope changing.
  - One of the things that I really, REALLY wanted to do, was to add secrets inside
    hint levels.
  - Sadly, I don't think it would've hit as good as I felt, so I had to scrap it.
  - There was also supposed to be one "level" per orb collected, that would be required
    to enter the core.
  - ...I was running out of level ideas by that point, haha.
  - Lastly, I also wanted to hide more codes in plain sight, like the one you used
    to get here.
  - That would've been wayyyy too much work. So I settled for this instead.
