  - Did you know?
  - ADC was meant to be my final school project!
  - I actually got a good grade, and a lot of feedback to expand upon it.
  - I will say, I probably didn't add as many mechanics as I thought from the beginning,
    but that's a good thing.
  - Trust me.
  - So, this project was supposed to be a month only, but ended up taking wayyy too
    long.
  - Overscoping and overscoping until I had to cut content! It was too exhausting.
  - I'm very satisfied, though.
