  - Yo!
  - Welcome to the dev room. In here, you'll hear me (Lumi, the developer) talk briefly
    about the game.
  - Did you get here by accident? I would recommend to leave and find your way after
    beating the game!
  - The code for this level is very well hidden, but in plain sight.
  - If you haven't found it, don't worry! You're welcome here anyways.
  - So... Have at you!
