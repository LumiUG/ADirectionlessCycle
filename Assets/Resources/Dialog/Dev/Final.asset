  - Before you go, I'm incredibly grateful for people like you playing my game.
  - You are one of the few people that most likely managed to get this far to see
    this room.
  - This "two" year long journey has been very special to me, and I am happy to have
    been able to share it.
  - From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I hope you've had your fun playing this
    stupid passion project of mine.
  - And for those of you that can hear me. I can hear you, too.
