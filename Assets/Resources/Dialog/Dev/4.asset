  dialog:
  - Lumi!
  - The original game's story was about-
  - No, it wasn't about Lumi. But sometimes I'd like to think it was.
  - It was about "trying to stop the universe from collapsing".
  - Apparently from whatever universe this was from, that was like a super common
    thing.
  - Funny how the entire story changed to "destroy what's left of a game", ironic.
  - Wondering who the canon game developer is? I don't know!
  - My headcanon is that Lumi made it... But you aren't ready for that conversation.
  - Alright, say bye to him! We're ending this.
