  - Did they contact you aswell? Oh, please. They only want to end us.
  - I need you to fix this place and make us stay. Keep playing, keep completing
    unvoided levels.
  - Every time you complete a positive level, you're helping us fix this place!
  - And, yes, we know this is a game for you. But it isn't for us.
  - Don't listen to them. You're doing great!
