  - Hey, the developer here.
  - This should be IMPOSSIBLE to trigger. But here we are.
  - You are reading this, since you just interacted with something off-screen.
  - Remember that one mimic that you just saw being pushed out?
  - That's the one.
  - I would've added a freeroam secret here, but this is SO much funnier!
  - Have fun, you amazing piece of a human being.
  - Thank you for playing <3
