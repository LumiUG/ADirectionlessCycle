  - Testing, testing, can you hear me?
  - ...
  - Oh! Right, I'm so sorry. It's not like you can actually talk back.
  - In this state, you don't really have a body, anyways.
  - And hopefully not too much amnesia? If so, don't worry about it!
  - I'll be your guiding angel!! Or, um- well... Your guiding voice? Sorry, I'm bad
    with this stuff.
  - A-Anyways, as we were talking before, you should go with the flow of this world.
  - What I mean is "no detours, focus on your objective"
  - ...Personally, It's just company policy. Do whatever you feel like.
  - Though, I'd advise against snooping around in places too deep. You're supposed
    to get in and out. Safely.
  - Just do your job and we'll all be alright!
  - Now, I have other crawlers to take care of. I'll see you around if something
    interesting happens.
