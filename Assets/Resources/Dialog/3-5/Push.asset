  - Yeah... The core.
  - Don't think we've talked too much about the core, have we?
  - Well, where to begin...
  - 'The core was created as the last area in the game, a sort of "maze" showcasing
    everything you''ve seen. '
  - Unfortunately for you, everything has degraded.
  - I do have some sort of plan, though. But it requires you to go exploring some
    places.
  - Don't stress about it right now, there's no use. I'll try to make it fun for
    you.
