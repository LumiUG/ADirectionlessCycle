  - And with time, everything erodes. You must've found... Where did you find us?
  - Odd, last thing we've heard was that this whole thing was being cancelled.
  - ...Anyhow, don't forget to ask us for a hint if you need it.
  - Or, well, "not" us. You can use the lightbulb from your pause menu for that.
