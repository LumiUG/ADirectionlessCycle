  - Hey, I'm back. Congrats on making it into area two.
  - They didn't give you too much trouble, I hope?
  - 'Well, It doesn''t matter right now. '
  - Sorry for leaving before, I was consulting some stuff, and making sure everything
    is ready for you.
  - There's a "forced entry" in this area, I'll explain everything there.
  - For now, just try to follow along! Enjoy while you're at it. There won't be anything
    soon.
