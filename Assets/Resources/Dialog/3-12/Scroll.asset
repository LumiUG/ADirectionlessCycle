  - This'll be the last thing you need to know.
  - When traversing across screens, you can take other shapes with you.
  - To do so, both of 'you' must move out of the screen at the same time.
  - The other shape, however, must be one tile away from the next screen, or moving
    into it.
  - Confusing? Sure is.
  - Just make sure to exit at the same time, and you'll be able to pull it off every
    time.
