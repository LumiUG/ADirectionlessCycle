  - It is quite interesting how the developer designed some of the levels.
  - Apparently, this level's behaviour was a bug, but later was repurposed in as
    a mechanic.
  - In my opinion, it is stupid. A bug is a bug.
  - The developer even made levels with mimics! You've seen them before, right?
  - Well, apparently if you placed two of them next to eachother, everything would
    crash!
  - And it's still in the game! Unbelieveable.
