  - Okay! Don't look at me like that. There's only one that I know of.
  - Let's move on, 'kay? Treat that as a thank you for helping them.

  - Well, I don't think Meem or Ploof count.
  - Oh, and don't worry, they do come visit sometime.
  - So... That's all you'll get from this version of me.
  - Thank you for giving them rest. See you around!
