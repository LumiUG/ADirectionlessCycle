    m_Localized: I actually ran out of ideas, here. Can you believe it?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 2333094318080
    m_Localized: Sure, I could've made an entire puzzle here, but... Oh well.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 2334616850432
    m_Localized: Hey, this is better than a puzzle, riiiiiiiiiiight?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 2335447322624
    m_Localized: Of course it is!

    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: I'll add a little something to your title screen, yes?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: You keep searching for secrets, I'll do that.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: We'll say that if you continue, you agree.

    m_Localized: Hey.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4924582793216
    m_Localized: On the early days, this was deemed one of the hardest puzzles.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4925501345792
    m_Localized: We would help you, but we are forbidden to give... hints... here...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4926587670528
    m_Localized: Actually, who cares? All you need to do is- %end%
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: '%begin% Haha... Let''s not, actually.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5595621101568
    m_Localized: Yeah. It's a hard puzzle, but we'll adhere to what was said.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5941894451200
    m_Localized: But hey, if it makes you feel better... There's a nice fire down
      there, go warm up.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8437454999552
    m_Localized: It is quite interesting how the developer designed some of the levels.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8438113505280
    m_Localized: Apparently, this level's behaviour was a bug, but later was repurposed
      in as a mechanic.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8438839119872
    m_Localized: In my opinion, it is stupid. A bug is a bug.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8440684613632
    m_Localized: The developer even made levels with mimics! You've seen them before,
      right?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8441573806080
    m_Localized: Well, apparently if you placed two of them next to eachother, everything
      would crash!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8442563661824
    m_Localized: And it's still in the game! Unbelieveable.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8754938646528
    m_Localized: Uhh...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8755542626304
    m_Localized: Yeah...!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8756163383296
    m_Localized: There's no more codes left!! How dare you find this area?!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8756805111808
    m_Localized: Maybe... Maybe if you're an editor?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8757576863744
    m_Localized: Just for you, just for you. Try out "overflow".
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11507517755392
    m_Localized: Stop! Don't move.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11508184649728
    m_Localized: This entire level is a trick. Don't you see?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11508826378240
    m_Localized: Bear with me, hold [SPACE] or [TRIANGLE] and look at that box on
      your top left.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11509942063104
    m_Localized: No, don't try it now. Do it outside of this interaction.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11510835449856
    m_Localized: One wrong move, and you'll get kicked out of here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11511858860032
    m_Localized: Better count your steps...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1845989468147712
    m_Localized: Get out! What are you doing here?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1845990105681920
    m_Localized: I told you there was nothing, NOTHING.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1845990793547776
    m_Localized: Do you hate us? Do you dislike me so much that you'd like to see
      me cease to be?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1845991443664896
    m_Localized: '... '
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1845992106364928
    m_Localized: Please. Stay away from all this.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: '[The carvings have dimmed?]'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1846402317684736
    m_Localized: I don't think they took that very well.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1846700872437760
    m_Localized: Sorry you had to read that, I'll make sure to overwrite anything
      next time.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1846701887459328
    m_Localized: They don't want this to end, however hard it gets.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1846702743097344
    m_Localized: It is... commendable, but we both know it isn't the right thing.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1846703867170816
    m_Localized: You know, after all this time it'd just be better to dissapear.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1846986466791424
    m_Localized: And, heads up. You should come back to this level later to finish
      it. I doubt you'd understand half of these mechanics.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1850985840513024
    m_Localized: Another- another one! Let me read the cypher...

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1851095186018304
    m_Localized: Oh, come on, I won't give it up. Keep going, go on!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1851097123786752
    m_Localized: I'll repeat it, just incase you forgot.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1853774943621120
    m_Localized: It's just... been difficult. I'm actually surprised I havent gone
      mad.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1853775614709760
    m_Localized: The developer... I can't be nothing but sorry for them. They really
      liked this game.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1853776289992704
    m_Localized: It's a shame that this was abandoned, but at least I'd thought they
      would erase everything, so not to cause pain.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1853776969469952
    m_Localized: Nothing to do, other than watch and change little things.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1853777632169984
    m_Localized: This program being dormant is so boring! Everything is in read-only.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1853778303258624
    m_Localized: We aren't actually "allowed" to edit any levels, only when it's
      on. Well, you've seen what they can do.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1853778982735872
    m_Localized: So, yeah. I'm actually tired of existing. Just end us? Haha...

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3302352530575360
    m_Localized: Hopefully using scrapped code for his AI won't have any repercusions.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3302353335881728
    m_Localized: Hah, just doing this is already a massive risk.
    m_Metadata:
