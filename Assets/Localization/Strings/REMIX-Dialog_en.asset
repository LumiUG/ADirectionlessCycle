    m_Localized: Sure, I could've made an entire puzzle here, but... Oh well.

    m_Localized: Hey.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4924582793216
    m_Localized: On the early days, this was deemed one of the hardest puzzles.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4925501345792
    m_Localized: We would help you, but we are forbidden to give... hints... here...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4926587670528
    m_Localized: Actually, who cares? All you need to do is- %end%

    m_Localized: '%begin% Haha... Let''s not, actually.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5595621101568
    m_Localized: Yeah. It's a hard puzzle, but we'll adhere to what was said.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5941894451200
    m_Localized: But hey, if it makes you feel better... There's a nice fire down
      there, go warm up.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8437454999552
    m_Localized: It is quite interesting how the developer designed some of the levels.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8438113505280
    m_Localized: Apparently, this level's behaviour was a bug, but later was repurposed
      in as a mechanic.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8438839119872
    m_Localized: In my opinion, it is stupid. A bug is a bug.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8440684613632
    m_Localized: The developer even made levels with mimics! You've seen them before,
      right?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8441573806080
    m_Localized: Well, apparently if you placed two of them next to eachother, everything
      would crash!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8442563661824
    m_Localized: And it's still in the game! Unbelieveable.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8754938646528
    m_Localized: Uhh...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8755542626304
    m_Localized: Yeah...!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8756163383296
    m_Localized: There's no more codes left!! How dare you find this area?!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8756805111808
    m_Localized: Maybe... Maybe if you're an editor?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8757576863744
    m_Localized: Just for you, just for you. Try out "overflow".
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11507517755392
    m_Localized: Stop! Don't move.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11508184649728
    m_Localized: This entire level is a trick. Don't you see?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11508826378240
    m_Localized: Bear with me, hold [SPACE] or [TRIANGLE] and look at that box on
      your top left.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11509942063104
    m_Localized: No, don't try it now. Do it outside of this interaction.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11510835449856
    m_Localized: One wrong move, and you'll get kicked out of here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11511858860032
    m_Localized: Better count your steps...
