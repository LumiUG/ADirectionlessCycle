    m_Localized: Should it be this painful? I'm opening old wounds just by being
      here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 13390466650112
    m_Localized: It's funny. I've only but dreamt of being able to modify the code,
      and now-
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 13571656388608
    m_Localized: Shit. I must stop thinking about it. I can't fuck this up.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 13770596421632
    m_Localized: Even if this is for the better, aren't I deciding for them? ...Maybe
      they want to get erased?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 14083520860160
    m_Localized: Can't say I didn't consider it, but is this the right choice?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 14326379450368
    m_Localized: Hah, I'll never know.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: I'm just... So tired.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 15485664104448
    m_Localized: ... Let's get it over with.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 12547768061952
    m_Localized: Writing still works, just perfect.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 12551236751360
    m_Localized: Hello, whoever's... No one's going to read this.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 12553581367296
    m_Localized: I've managed to get into this copy of the executable, regrettably
      with little access.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 12587081273344
    m_Localized: My goal here is simple. I'm getting both of them out.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 12601018945536
    m_Localized: Unfortunately, the only way for me to do so is if a player runs
      the completion function.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18818822967296
    m_Localized: Which... Borrowing code from the delete function is the only way
      I've managed to make this work.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 742848249073664
    m_Localized: So... That's it? Can't I do more than this?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 743592276660224
    m_Localized: I don't think they can detect me in their system. That is until
      I show myself to them.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 743871164321792
    m_Localized: And I'm not going to do that. That would compromise the plan.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 744038072455168
    m_Localized: Can I really not do anything??
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 744173619777536
    m_Localized: This might take them... At this rate, years, at least. And they're
      alon-
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 744300635885568
    m_Localized: Hang on, I could- I have an idea.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 754158504382464
    m_Localized: '[It made some sort of barking sound.]'

    m_Localized: '[It looks neglected.]'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 754161939517440
    m_Localized: '[Maybe someday...]'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 754833854435328
    m_Localized: The core... It all ends here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 754834462609408
    m_Localized: The way to get into it is completely ruined. It's such a mess.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 754835385356288
    m_Localized: Thankfully, I've been monitoring this level closely.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 754836287131648
    m_Localized: I did make another entry to get to the last level, but... It's not
      so easy.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 754928440184832
    m_Localized: I made a small path, and some warps for you. Hopefully that's enough.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1122902971912192
    m_Localized: After that, we... Won't be here... Anymore.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1122902065942528
    m_Localized: If you get to the center, the bottom, it'll be done for us. Just
      like that.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1122901453574144
    m_Localized: It's degraded so badly we believe everything has started looping
      itself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1122900925091840
    m_Localized: The function to "delete everything" should run as soon as you clear
      the level.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1123448298541056
    m_Localized: Whatever you find down there... Be strong, do it for us.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1123446058782720
    m_Localized: So, this might be the last time we can communicate with you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1123442774642688
    m_Localized: We don't really have access down there.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1123852776247296
    m_Localized: So... good luck. And if you need a hint...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1123855888420864
    m_Localized: We'll be with you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1123857528393728
    m_Localized: Er, in spirit, I mean. Or whatever you believe in.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1123904999526400
    m_Localized: 'Sneaky! '
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1123906488504320
    m_Localized: I've never understood how these work, or what they are. Do you?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1342689631145984
    m_Localized: Pay attention to your surroundings. Follow that which the light
      does not pass.
