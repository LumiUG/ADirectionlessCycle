    m_Localized: I've created a wrong warp on "3-10", just interact five times with
      the broken wall on your right.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6179782791168
    m_Localized: That's where you'll need to go after getting the last fragment.

    m_Localized: It won't have enough power to open a rift if you don't!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 9855553376256
    m_Localized: And you had to jump in here.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 9856878776320
    m_Localized: No matter, we don't have enough power to open a rift yet, anyways.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431660696997888
    m_Localized: Finally here! Took you a while.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431661984649216
    m_Localized: I've actually managed to make this level just for you, as one of
      the preparations I was talking about.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431663997915136
    m_Localized: We might not have much power here, but at least we can do something.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431665012936704
    m_Localized: Okay! Let's start with the basics, you'll understand how it works
      when you see it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431669362429952
    m_Localized: Go on, and press [C] or [RT] to cycle.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431798014316544
    m_Localized: Go on, and press [C] or [RT] to cycle.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431947331538944
    m_Localized: You'll see! Cycle into a Hex, and move into that broken wall on
      your right.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431946341683200
    m_Localized: Yes... You couldn't do it before. Only after getting the fragments
      it unlocks it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431945620262912
    m_Localized: By cycling, you can now access areas you couldn't reach before.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 431944953368576
    m_Localized: Great. Now here's the fun part...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432259819769856
    m_Localized: That's it. Just as simple.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432260432138240
    m_Localized: Now every time you see something like this, you know what to do!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432261870784512
    m_Localized: There are also different cases, try stuff out!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432353801539584
    m_Localized: Aaand, told you this would be worth the detour! Go on then, have
      fun.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432353004621824
    m_Localized: Just keep in mind, broken walls indicate new screens.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432352383864832
    m_Localized: I like that attitude, surely you've just gotten some new ideas.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432351725359104
    m_Localized: Well? What do you think? Getting the hang of it?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432751572553728
    m_Localized: That's about it, good luck, player.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432750804996096
    m_Localized: To complete levels with it... Hm, actually you'll figure it out.
      Be careful with your order!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432750079381504
    m_Localized: There are now "outbound" areas. These work differently than inverse
      ones.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 432749429264384
    m_Localized: And, as a last thing.
