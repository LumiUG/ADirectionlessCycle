    m_Localized: No, no, no. I'm not decyphering whatever's in here, you're missing

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11519756734464
    m_Localized: I suppose you've got this one, but you'll have to do better than

    m_Localized: We like to call these places "true freeroam", since you can fully
      explore a level without being confined to your screen.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 64976022802432
    m_Localized: Yeah, it's definitely not supposed to be walled off.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Usually, you'd be able to get it right now, but...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: It's used to unlock the core, your final destination.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: "This is the artifact level, and I don't know where it is. Which\u2026

  - m_Id: 69220398403584
    m_Localized: Definitely not... "happy" about helping you both. But I've come
      to realize you are just trying to help.

    m_Localized: The terrain... I can't believe it's gotten this bad.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 72826203803648
    m_Localized: Dead end. I think I we saw something back on your beginning screen.
      Check the bottom.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 72828204486656
    m_Localized: It doesn't seem reachable, though. You'll have to make your way.

    m_Localized: That being said, this is definitely not how I remember it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 74335494737920

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 74399604674560

      on the inverse levels.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 74400217042944
    m_Localized: And I should be the hints on the main levels, but I've grown bored
      of them.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 74472669450240
    m_Localized: Y-yeah! Nothing, sorry.
