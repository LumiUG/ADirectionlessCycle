    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Dead end. I think I we saw something back on your beginning screen.
      Check the bottom.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

      on the inverse levels.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 74400217042944
    m_Localized: And I should be the hints on the main levels, but I've grown bored

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1398831728168960
    m_Localized: They're outside of your "view", but you'll have to find and decypher
      them yourself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1398830918668288

      know this?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1399103003168768
    m_Localized: Regardless, it'll "remove" them painlessly from this game. So we
      can... still exist.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1399104416649216
    m_Localized: ...And be alone.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1403976629227520
    m_Localized: Of course, there are multiple copies of it, so it's not the prettiest
      thing.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
