    m_Localized: ...A-among other stuff.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 496448550604800
    m_Localized: Sorry, I don't have much to say. I just don't like this place much.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 496449129418752
    m_Localized: As you can see, it'll degrade more and more the closer you get to
      the core.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 496450245103616
    m_Localized: Which I'm guessing you're on your way there, because of course you
      are.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 500908379213824
    m_Localized: The void was able to claim this exit. Can you see it?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 500913060057088
    m_Localized: I remember the developer being especially fond of this third area.
      And to be honest, I can kinda see the vision.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 500913538207744
    m_Localized: Took their sweet time with it, too. To really flesh everything out-
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 500914695835648
    m_Localized: Oh? The exit? You don't have what you need yet.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 504384836472832
    m_Localized: Haha, It's always not as easy at it seems.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Yeah... The core.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 504921778688000
    m_Localized: Don't think we've talked too much about the core, have we?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 504922462359552
    m_Localized: Well, where to begin...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 504923070533632
    m_Localized: 'The core was created as the last area in the game, a sort of "maze"
      showcasing everything you''ve seen. '
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 504924223967232
    m_Localized: Unfortunately for all of us, everything has degraded.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 504925385789440
    m_Localized: I do have some sort of plan, though. But it requires you to go exploring
      some places.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 504926425976832
    m_Localized: Don't stress about it right now, there's no use. I'll try to make
      it fun for you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 509084843511808
    m_Localized: I'm well aware why they want you to reach the core.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 509085489434624
    m_Localized: You don't seem so aware, though. It's like you're doing this for
      no reason. Would you like an explanation?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 509086177300480
    m_Localized: Of course.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 509087091658752
    m_Localized: They believe that the core has some sort of function to delete data.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 509087859216384
    m_Localized: And I mean, they aren't wrong. We know for a fact it exists. It's
      just...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 509088928763904
    m_Localized: It's definitely broken! It has to be, it's just too degraded, or
      something could've...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 509089784401920
    m_Localized: Ugh! Why would activating the game's ending delete us? It just makes
      no sense! There's no way the memory addresses got this bad.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 509090946224128
    m_Localized: Unless... Did they find a way to activate the function from there?
      N-no, they... I did see someone tampering with memory, but...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 511467879272448
    m_Localized: Regardless! You're way too valuable. We wouldn't want you losing
      contact with us, or corrupting the game.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 512703189880832
    m_Localized: So... Stay here, will you?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 514214087233536
    m_Localized: Ah...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 514219338502144
    m_Localized: By the way, sorry if you see some carvings left open, player. Sometimes
      we forget to erase them.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 514219908927488
    m_Localized: Not this one, though! You. Aren't. Reading that. Ever- %end%
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 517685049954304
    m_Localized: One of the more interesting levels. Oh the reaction you'll have
      when it clicks.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 517685712654336
    m_Localized: What? You didn't think this would be one of the last levels, did
      you?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 517687172272128
    m_Localized: The core waits, the core waits.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 518025342226432
    m_Localized: You made it. The artifact you are looking for is in the next level.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 518028110467072
    m_Localized: We don't have any tips on this one, but you can probably figure
      it out. It's very straightforward.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 519970601701376
    m_Localized: 3-10... How I've come to hate this place.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: It's filled with cyphers, which are annoying. I'll decypher them
      for you myself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 520055997730816
    m_Localized: Starting with this one!

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 520327209816064
    m_Localized: It's fun! Besides, if I tell you now, it would ruin the surprise,
      wouldn't it?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 520327872516096
    m_Localized: But if you'd like to know... It's a mechanic that was abandoned
      by the developer.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 520339742396416
